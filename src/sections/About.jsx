                    Hi, I'm Bakhtiyor! I'm heading into my junior year at the <b>University of Pittsburgh</b>, majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Economics, and pursuing the Pitt Honors Degree and a Certificate in Leadership. I love building things, solving problems, and bringing ideas to life â€” whether through code or collaboration. With a passion for both strategy and technology, Iâ€™m working toward a future in software development or consulting, using my skills in CS, economics, and finance to make a real impact. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Right now, I'm interning at <b>U.S. Steel</b>, where Iâ€™m gaining hands-on experience in UI development and big data engineering â€” from building React-based dashboards to designing data pipelines. Every step has helped me grow and explore the intersection of tech and business. Iâ€™ve also worked on a variety of personal projects, and incorporated my hobbies into them. Be sure to check them out! As far as this website, I built it to share a little more about myself, and showcase some of the cool things I've worked on. I used <i>React, HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.</i>
                    <br /><br />
                    Outside of work, I love exploring and trying new things. I've had the opportunity
                    to travel all over the world, being from Uzbekistan myself, I've loved taking in 
                    different cultures. I've always had an appreciation for music, and a few years ago
                    I picked up the guitar and have loved it since. Playing and learning new songs takes up
                    more of my time than it shouldðŸ˜… Along with music, I enjoy learning and playing chess. I'm big into sports,
                    both as a fan and athlete. I've played hockey, soccer, basketball, & tennis throughout
                    my life. Also a huge Pittsburgh sports fan. But enough about me, thanks for visiting my page!
